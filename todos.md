From conversation with ChatGPT:

Your current `super-join` library is quite well structured and impressively functional for converting GraphQL into SQL. You're already abstracting aliases, joins, and field resolution effectively. Since you're planning for future extensibility ‚Äî like where clauses, junction tables, parameters, and subqueries ‚Äî now is a great time to discuss architectural enhancements before implementation gets more complex.

## üîç High-Level Opportunities for Improvement

### 1. **Composable SQL AST**

**Why:** Right now, `SqlSelect` includes only columns and joins. As you add filtering, subqueries, ordering, etc., this will grow more complex and less manageable.

**Conceptual Enhancement:**
Create a more composable SQL AST to support:

* `SELECT`
* `FROM`
* `JOIN`
* `WHERE`
* `GROUP BY`
* `ORDER BY`
* `LIMIT`, etc.

**Suggested Struct (simplified):**

```rust
pub struct SqlSelect {
    pub table: String,
    pub alias: String,
    pub columns: Vec<SqlColumn>,
    pub joins: Vec<SqlJoin>,
    pub where_clause: Option<SqlExpr>,
    pub order_by: Vec<SqlOrderBy>,
    pub limit: Option<u32>,
}
```

---

### 2. **Add Expression Support for WHERE and JOIN ON**

**Why:** SQL clauses like `WHERE` or `ON` often require expressions (e.g., `a.id = b.user_id AND b.active = true`).

**Conceptual Enhancement:**
Define an AST for SQL expressions:

```rust
pub enum SqlExpr {
    Eq(SqlValue, SqlValue),
    And(Box<SqlExpr>, Box<SqlExpr>),
    Or(Box<SqlExpr>, Box<SqlExpr>),
    Column(String),
    Literal(String),
    Param(String),
}
```

This enables composability and safe code generation. You could even serialize these expressions from JS.

---

### 3. **Query Parameters (Dynamic Values)**

**Why:** To avoid SQL injection and improve performance with prepared statements.

**Conceptual Enhancement:**
Incorporate parameters into your expression AST:

```ts
where: {
  type: "eq",
  left: { type: "column", name: "user.id" },
  right: { type: "param", name: "userId" },
}
```

Then, compile to:

```sql
WHERE "user"."id" = $userId
```

And accept parameters in a map `{ userId: 42 }`.

---

### 4. **Junction Tables / Many-to-Many**

**Why:** Common GraphQL schemas use many-to-many patterns (e.g., `users -> posts` via `post_likes`).

**Conceptual Enhancement:**
Extend `JoinInfo`:

```ts
{
  join_type: "junction",
  through: {
    table: "post_likes",
    alias: "likes",
    on_clause: `"likes".user_id = "user".id AND "likes".post_id = "post".id`
  },
  target: {
    alias: "post",
    extends: "post",
    on_clause: `"likes".post_id = "post".id`
  }
}
```

---

### 5. **Add `FieldArgs` Support**

**Why:** GraphQL fields often have arguments (`posts(limit: 10, order: "desc")`), which are important for SQL `LIMIT`, `ORDER BY`, and filtering.

**Conceptual Enhancement:**
Parse and pass arguments to `build_sql_ast`, optionally attach them to your AST:

```rust
pub struct SqlFieldArgs {
    pub limit: Option<u32>,
    pub order_by: Option<String>,
}
```

And integrate those in SQL generation.

---

### 6. **Hydration Step**

**Why:** You eventually want to hydrate flat SQL results into nested GraphQL responses.

**Conceptual Enhancement:**
You‚Äôre already planning this, but here‚Äôs a high-level idea:

* Accept rows as a flat list of maps.
* Group by the outer alias (`user_1_id`), and nest according to field names and aliases.
* You can precompute a "response blueprint" during SQL AST generation to guide nesting.

---

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

If you'd like, I can help with:

* Implementing `SqlExpr` with parameter support.
* Defining an updated SQL AST to support all future needs.
* Modifying `JoinInfo` to support junctions.
* Enhancing `build_sql_ast` to recurse through and collect `WHERE`, `LIMIT`, etc.
* Designing a `hydrate_results` function that reconstructs nested objects from flat SQL rows.

Would you like to start with any of those (e.g., `SqlExpr` or `junction table joins`)?
